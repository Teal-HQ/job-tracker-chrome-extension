# Teal's Job Tracker Chrome Extension

## Boilerplate

<https://github.com/duo-labs/chrome-extension-boilerplate>

## Get started

Clone this repository, and then, in this directory:

1. `npm install`
2. `npx webpack`

Your unpacked Chrome extension will be compiled into `dist/`. You can load it into Chrome by enabling developer mode on the "Extensions" page, hitting "Load unpacked", and selecting the `dist/` folder. You can pack the extension into a `.crx` by using the "Pack extension" button on the same page.

Use `npx webpack` to recompile after editing.

## Source layout

* `background.ts` will get loaded as the extension background script, and will run persistently in the background [NOT USED CURRENTLY]
* `content.ts` will be injected into the URLs matched by `dist/manifest.json`'s `matches` entry (see [Match Patterns](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns) documentation)
* `popup.tsx` will become the extension's "browser action" popup
  * NOTE: `popup.tsx` compiles into `dist/js/popup.js`. It is loaded into `dist/popup.html` by an explicit `<script>` tag on that page. `dist/popup.html` is static and is not automatically generated by the build process.
* `popup.css` contains styles for the popup. These styles are loaded with `style-loader` via the `import` line at the top of `popup.tsx` (and directly injected into the popup via JavaScript)

## Dist

`dist` contains the Chrome extension. You can delete `js/*`, as its contents will be regenerated by `webpack`, but the rest of the contents of `dist` will not.

## Publishing a new version of the extension

* Only members of Teal's Web Tools Google Group that have paid the developer fee can publish a new version. Please contact Keith Gould if you need access to the group.

* Go to the [extension developer dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/u/3/webstore/devconsole/f2736abb-9371-4647-86d2-4cfd0566d913) and click on the extension's name in the items list.

* Click on the `Package` link in the left navigation menu.

* Click on `Upload new package`

* Upload a zip file containing all the files in the `dist` dir (make sure to run `npx webpack` before creating the zip file and to bump the version accordingly in the `manifest.json` file)

* Submit for review (it might take between 2 to 5 days to get the new version published)

* After confirming that the new version got published (status is `Published` in the dashboard items page), please let the team know by posting the changes on the #goods_tools Slack channel
